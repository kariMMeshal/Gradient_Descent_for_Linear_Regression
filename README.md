# Gradient Descent for Linear Regression

This project implements a simple **Gradient Descent algorithm** to perform **Linear Regression** and predict house prices based on their square footage (sqft).

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The model learns the relationship between house size (in sqft) and price using gradient descent to minimize the cost function.

## ðŸ“Š Whatâ€™s Inside
- A dataset of house sizes and prices (manually defined)
- A gradient descent implementation from scratch (no ML libraries)
- A matplotlib style config file (`deeplearning.mplstyle`) for cleaner plots
- Plotting of the cost function and regression line

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Prediction

The trained model can predict the price of a house given its square footage using the learned linear relationship.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `deeplearning.mplstyle` â†’ Plot style configuration

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run the cells sequentially
3. View the training progress and prediction plots
